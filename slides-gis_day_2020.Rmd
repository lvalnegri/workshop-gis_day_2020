# Spatial Data Representation

 - In general, there are two main family of spatial data, each dealt in its own way 

--

   - Vector: point, lines, polygons

--

   - Raster: regular grids

--

   In the current session, we are going to deal only with vector data: Points and Polygons 

--

 - Normally, in spatial data analysis each spatial object has a dataset attached to it, storing data related to each of its entities


---
# CRS Coordinate Reference Systems

 - Places and areas can be located by means of two main types of coordinates: geographic and projected. In both cases

   - *geographic*: 
     - angular units, measured in degrees (can't be used to measure length and areas)
     - easily adaptable to all the world
     - a point has two coordinate values: latitude (y axis or NS) and longitude (x-axis oe EW)
     - the *Greenwich* Meridian separates East from West
     - the *Equator* separates north from south

---
# CRS Coordinate Reference Systems

   - *projected*
     - mathematical transformations to from the surface of a spheroid to representative positions on a flat surface 
     - 
     - it's not possible to maintain both areas and distances
     - *ellipsoid*, *datum*, *projection* method 
     
---
# R as a GIS

 - When using web application, it is customary to use the so called *WGS84*, [World Geodetic System 1984](https://epsg.io/4326), identified by `epsg:4326`.

--

 - Its unit is the *degree* related to angles, so it can't be used to measure areas or lengths.

--

 - To measure areas or distance you need to *project* the earth on a plane.


   - For Great Britan: [British National Grid, OSGB_1936](https://epsg.io/27700) with `epsg:27700` 

--

   - For Ireland: [Irish Grid, GCS_TM65](https://epsg.io/29902) with `epsg:29902`


---
# R as a GIS

 - Using the *sp* packages, Points and Polygons are represented by the classes:
   - `SpatialPointsDataFrame`
   - `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`

--

 - Both objects are partitioned in *slots*, accessed using the `@` operator

--

 - *Points* contains a `coords` slot that stores the coordinates of each point, 

--

 - *Polygons* contains a `polygons` slot that stores, among other information, the coordinates related to each polygon 


---
# R as a GIS

Other slots common to both classes are:
 
--

 - `data` a dataframe that stores the data connected to each entity
 
--

 - `bbox` the coordinates for the *bounding box*, the minimum square box that can include all the entities.  
 
--

 - `proj4string` a string that define the *coordinate reference system* (CRS) and the *projection* (if coordinates are projected) 
 
--

   It can be written in the form `+init=epsg:x` where `x` is a code that define 

-- 

 - It is not sufficient to replace the proj4string`` slot to change the actual projection of the object.
You also need to apply the required mathematical transormation (in*sp* package you need to run `spTransform`)


--- 
# Main Spatial Operations

 - CROP crop(bnd, extent) keep only features of one spatial object that fall inside the *extent* of another spatial object

--

 - DISSOLVE when a spatial object is made up as an association of smaller objects, you delete the internal relation of these to retain only the outer shape

--

 - SIMPLIFY reduce the complexity of the lines that build the polygons, this is typical in choropleths as the geographic details are not important 

--

 - PIP Point In Polygon

--- 
# Main Spatial Operations

 - UNION

--

 - INTERSECT

--

 - DIFFERENCE

--

 - SYMMETRICAL DIFFERENCE

--

 - MERGE


---
# Leaflet

 - you don't need to convert your dataframe in a spatial object, as the locations can be read directly from their long/lat

--

 - polygons (boundaries) must be passed as *sp*, *sf*, *geojson*, *kml*

--

 - do not try to render too many features, if not necessary. For example Output Areas: do not map all the UK boundaries, they are 232,296! but first subset by Region

--

 - do not add too many labels and/or popups, these are not created on the fly but all of them beforehand and remain part of the map. 

-- 

 - you can use Shiny to create only the popup needed at the time
